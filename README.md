# Fire-Detection - Firefront

Code used on for my thesis - Wildfire Detection using Self-Supervised Learning. The code is ment to be executed on Google Colab environment using Python3.

The code is divided into two phases: Self-supervised phase and supervised phase. For the first phase, three diferent pretext task were implemented in order to pretrain part of the network. For the second phase, a classifier was achieved using the pretrained networks obtain during the previous phase. 

The dataset used for this work is available at Dataset
